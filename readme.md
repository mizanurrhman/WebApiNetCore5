C# Assignment 1

Create a console project named “DataTypeIO”
For following data types, create an array of size 5 (single dimension).
Integer
Double
Float
String
DateTime
Decimal
Long
bool
For each of the above data types, take input 5 values for each type from the user.
Then put these values in the array.
Then print the array values in the console.

As we have not covered loops yet, so if you are not supposed to use loops. 
You have to take 5 values for each type, so you can do it without a loop.

Delete your old code from your repository (the one that you have created previously) 
and then push the new assignment code in there. Then submit the github repository link in the assignment.

Go to google class room and open the assignment,
click “View Assignment” there in top right corner you will see a box called “Submit your work” 
there first attach your github link, then press “Turn in”
